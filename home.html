    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <div class='intro'>
      <p>This is where you can find my updated portfolio. Overall. the content is basically the same. But I decided to try a different layout. I initially enrolled in <a href='https://www.epicodus.com' target='_blank'>Epicodus' </a> <strong>introductory</strong> course, and had a <span class='largen'>previous portfolio</span>. Now that I'm in the <strong>fullstack</strong>, you're now looking at the <em>hopefully</em> upgraded version.</p>
      <p>This site basically has snippets of some of the work I've been playing with. You can see them if you click the link above <span class='largen'>PROJECTS</span>. You can peruse the website to read about me. Not that I have any interesting accomplishments or anything really worthwhile. It might be fun to read about some <span class='largen'>basic</span> person for your entertainment.</p>
      <p>Oh by the way, this box that contains the text is scroll-able. So make sure to scroll so you won't miiss any content!</p>
