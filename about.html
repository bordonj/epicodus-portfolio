    <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      After getting my doctorates, I felt like taking on another challenge to expand my set of skills even more. Throughout my academic career, I realized I enjoyed most of the data crunching and running statistical programs. I really found the <b>"behind-the-scenes"</b> work exciting, and heard that a coding career would encompass a similar type of workstyle. Back in middle school, I would design layouts for websites for free website platforms, such as <i><b>geocities, angelfire, xanga, and myspace.</b></i> Unfortunately, these were all deleted, and I lost my portfolio of work, in addition to my passion to continue coding back then. Now that I'm older, and heard of a possibility to regain the skills I once had (and learn a breadth and depth of much more!), I decided to take the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of my academic career, my research interests included studying the experiences of those <strong>underrepresented in STEM fields.</strong> I always admired those who were able to take on the challenge of being in a place that they may not felt they belonged in, especially how they navigated barriers and persevered. As I'm entering my life into a career, I think that being able to be in the tech industry would achieve one of my goals I've always had.

    <p id='hammyp'><img src="img/hamster.jpeg" id='hamster'>Some of my current interests include trying to gain more understanding of full-stack development. I'm interested in broadening my knowledge to learn of the powerful tools a developer has in creating their space in the web. On another note, my first pet I ever had was a hamster, and its name was <b>Zsa Zsa</b>. It was so cute, but its lifespan was only about 2 years. Afterwards, I never had a pet because of the heartbreak of losing one /sadface. I also enjoy <em>food</em>. Food is a necessity, and when I say food, I mean all kinds of food. I especially love spicy food! Szechuan handpulled noodles are one of my favorites. In terms of what I do to pass time, I like to browse youtube for cute animals.
