    <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      After getting my doctorates, I felt like taking on another challenge to expand my set of skills even more. Throughout my academic career, I realized I enjoyed most of the data crunching and running statistical programs. I really found the <b>"behind-the-scenes"</b> work exciting, and heard that a coding career would encompass a similar type of workstyle. Back in middle school, I would design layouts for websites for free website platforms, such as <i><b>geocities, angelfire, xanga, and myspace.</b></i> Unfortunately, these were all deleted, and I lost my portfolio of work, in addition to my passion to continue coding back then. Now that I'm older, and heard of a possibility to regain the skills I once had (and learn a breadth and depth of much more!), I decided to take the opportunity.

      In terms of my academic career, my research interests included studying the experiences of those <strong>underrepresented in STEM fields.</strong> I always admired those who were able to take on the challenge of being in a place that they may not felt they belonged in, especially how they navigated barriers and persevered. As I'm entering my life into a career, I think that being able to be in the tech industry would achieve one of my goals I've always had. The underrepresentation of certain groups of people in this field limits the advances and creativity the tech field could have, and hopefully I could add to it with my own unique experiences.
